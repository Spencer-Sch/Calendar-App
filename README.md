# A calendar app

## Needed a way to practice JavaScript classes/OOP and figured a calendar app would provide some opportunities to do so.

Day 1
* Built out beginnings of HTML structure.
    * I'm planning to generate a lot of the HTML in the JavaScript file so index.html will be pretty bare.
* Built out initial CSS.
    * Working to get CSS classes in place so they can be applied to generated HTML elements in the JavaScript.
