# A calendar app

## Needed a way to practice JavaScript classes/OOP and figured a calendar app would provide some opportunities to do so.

Day 1
* Built out beginnings of HTML structure.
    * I'm planning to generate a lot of the HTML in the JavaScript file so index.html will be pretty bare.
* Built out initial CSS.
    * Working to get CSS classes in place so they can be applied to generated HTML elements in the JavaScript.

Day 2
* Worked on building classes for each 'event' and 'day'.
    * Still working at understanding and increasing comfort with classes and OOP.
* Built logic to render a modal for inputting event data.
    * completed logic so that clicking a day will render a modal under that day.
    * completed logic so that clicking a day will close a currently rendered modal under that day.
    * completed logic so only one modal can be rendered at a time.
    * complted logic where activating a modal, while a modal is currently open on another day, will close the previous modal and open a modal on the newly selected day.

Day 3
* Changed 'modal' to 'addEventWindow' for more accurate description.
* Added functinality to insert event elements into each calendar day.

Day 4
* Added trash can icon to use as a 'delete event' button to each created event element.
* started work on 'delete event' functionality.
